The Federation Army will use Brigades and Regiments as their principle combat and maneuver unit. So SSIs in the Federation historically prioritized Brigade identification first, and higher-level command second.

The SSI is worn on the left shoulder (historically, the SSI is worn on the left shoulder because on older BDUs there were only two patches: the flag on the right shoulder and the unit patch on the left)

In the modern day, an SSI either identifies the Regiment or a Company. Rarely would SSI's for Divisions or Battalions be used.

On a combat uniform, at least an SSI on the left shoulder and national flag on the right is sufficient enough to meet uniform requirements.

At most, there an SSI can be worn on both shoulders, along with a flag and additional shoulder patch. The right SSI would be under the flag patch, and the left SSI under the additional patch.

If a regiment SSI is worn on both sides, the additional patch can be:
- Command Patch (same dimensions as the flag patch, e.g. rectangular ISAF patch)
- Division Identifying Tab (listing a shortened division name, e.g. "4th DIV")
- Battalion, Company, or Platoon Guidon Patch
- Shortened Unit Identifying Patch (ad-hoc rectangular patch, listing unit hirarchy, e.g. "J/2/5" for J Company, 2nd Battalion, 5th Regiment)
- Square Company-Platoon Patch (ad-hoc patch listing company letter, e.g. "J3" for 3th Platoon, J Company)

Ad-hoc patches are used when a company does not possess a unique SSI. If a unique company SSI is worn on both sides, then ad-hoc patches are not used. Guidon or Command Patches are prefered with unique company SSI's.

On a service uniform, the SSI is worn only on the left shoulder when wearing Regimental colors, or the Division SSI when "colorless."
