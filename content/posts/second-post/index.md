## unit insignia & patches

- divisions & corps will have a DUI & CSIB. these will be worn by soldiers occupying division-level billets, or units detached directly from division-level formations. uniforms are either worn "colorless" or with black colors (staff NCO's & field officers only). all units below use division DUI.

- regiments & brigades will also have a CSIB, beret flash, & regimental colors. however, if a unit lacks an CSIB, it will use the patch of the division it belongs to. if a unit lacks regimental colors, their uniform would be worn "colorless" or without any ornamental colors on the uniform. division DUI is used.

- battalion-level staff billets will wear regiment insignia, and division DUI.

- companies will have either a basic CSIB with regimental colors or will simply use the regiment CSIB for identification. distinctive companies may have a unique CSIB that could mix regimental colors with a unique color. smaller units like platoons that operate detached or independently from a regiment may also possess a unique CSIB.
