## Introduction

the relationship between magical energy, spirits, and life as a whole is loosely understood in this world, despite work by magicians, scientists and religious leaders. there are no hard rules or facts surrounding magic, only theories and data as to how it interacts with this world. but over millenia of using magic, these groups collectively presented a working theory as to how magic and spirits work.


### magic
magic, inherently, built off of the inherent ability in nature for objects or entities exert power or change upon other objects, whether through natural or supernatural means. what is commonly considered "magic" are changes through typically supernatural means. but it is no higher than other means of changing, influencing, or manipulating energy upon matter, like chemical or physical changes. magic is another branch of interaction in this world.


### magic energy
energy in the terms of magic is the power and ability to manipulate natural particles that exist in the universe. just like how delta-v is a measure to determine how much potential an object has to change velocity in a vaccuum, energy (for the purposes of this text) is a measure to determine how much potential an individual has to exert change upon particles in the universe.


### spirits & spirituality
spirituality is a regarded metric or quality as to how much magical energy something is capable to exert.

every life form in the universe possesses some form of spirituality. it is found by scientists that the amount of spirituality that a living being has correlates to the complexity of thought a living being possesses. while this explains why humanoid creatures are the best-known being to utilize magic, it is not used to explain how certain individuals are more apt to using magic than others. this detail can be further explained by spirits themselves.

spirituality does not inherently mean that a living organism has a spirit. a spirit is a manifestation of consciousness capable of sentient and independent thought. a plant may have spirituality and some tiny semblence of magical energy tied to it, it is not considered to have a spirit. while any life form can have a certain "spiritual" energy attached to them, only true sentient spirits can store, manipulate, and exert magical energy.

(in this universe, saying someone is "strong spirited" implies they have great magical energy)


### life
life itself is a manifestation of magic energy and spiritual energy (spirituality) in some form. magic energy is tied to an organism's body, while its spirit/spirituality is tied to an organism's capability for thought.

this is best measured in how an organism is able to interact with its environment and how it can adapt. organisms that are able to exert more interaction over its environment typically correlate with having higher magical energy.

the creation of a life form's body requires magical energy, however, and sometimes is an intensive process. there are no known reason as to why this is. 

one theory is that for a life form to possess any magical energy and be able to interact with its environment, it must first have enough energy to be invested in itself before it can live independently from its host/parent organism. this theory further explains that this energy investment correlates with the organism at hand â€” a bear has more magical potential than a plant, and thusly a bear cub must have more magical energy invested into its inception than a plant seed. however, this theory has not been proven beyond a doubt, but it is the most popular in the scientific community.

viruses, bacteria and single-celled organisms have also been a topic of contention in the scientific community as to their ability to possess magical energy, and be considered "alive" by that standard. although bacteria and single-celled organisms are considered "alive" as a fact, the topic of their magical potential is an ongoing discussion, as their lack of thought brings into question their spiritual qualities, and their miniscule size makes it difficult to prove or disprove their magical qualities.

one generally-accepted-fact, however, is that living creatures, entities that are capable to interact/adapt to their environment and reproduce, usually also require some sort of magic energy and spirituality to exist.


### age & health
a life form's health is dependent on its magical energy and age is dependent on its ability for its spiritual qualities to maintain its magical energy over time.

studies have found that spirits and other organisms with spiritual qualities have trouble maintaining magical energy as more time passes. 

however, it is also shown that human bodies will age normally despite an individual's magical energy or spirit. although individuals with strong spirits and high magical energy commonly age slightly "slower" than the median population, there are still countless examples of magic-adept users aging normally or "faster" than the common populous. genetics can still equally age a person "faster" or "slower" than normal.

how magical energy ties to a physical organism's health is not known, but magical energy has strong correlation with an organism's bodily function. an organism with less magic energy is found to be more prone to sickness, whilst injured animals/humanoids can heal more expediently when injected with magic energy from a magician. however, neither of these facts refute conventional science, which consistently more effective at stemming sickness and disease than magic.


### where magic comes from / how it is used by people
the current working theory presented by magicians and scientists is that magical energy exists in some other parrallel dimension(?) to this world, which is then pooled into this world through conjuration by a spirit. this explains how why it takes time for individuals to learn, harness, and master magic, as their spirit has to become more adept as conjuring pools of energy from another dimension(?).


### how enchantment works
magicians religious and magicians leaders also interpret this working theory to explain spirits, enchantment, and curses. items not considered "alive" can be artificially implanted with some semblence of spirituality to enhance its qualities to exert magical energy, despite an object not possessing any means to manipulate matter beyond physically. examples may be weapons of war being enchanted by battle mages to enhance their ability to cast magic, or enchanted swords greatly enhancing a non-magic user's abilities in combat.
